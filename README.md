# MIT Airport Rideshare
Our website (MIT Airport Rideshare) enables students to find other MIT students who are ridesharing to and from Logan Airport so that they can carpool together, save money, and feel safer while traveling.

Users can create a new ride group, filter through available ride groups to find one that fits their schedule, live message in group chats with other people in their ride, and add the ride to Apple/Google/Outlook/Yahoo calendars.

The “Find a Ride” page also has a smart filter that shows rides based on your preferences and only includes rides that you haven’t joined, still contain available spots, and are comfortable including students of your class year.
